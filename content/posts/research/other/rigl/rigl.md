[Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/287-Paper.pdf) is a paper published at [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020) with Utku Evci, Trevor Gale, Jacob Menick, and Erich Elsen, where we introduce an algorithm for training sparse neural networks that uses a fixed parameter count and computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods.

You can read more about it in the paper and in our [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/09/improving-sparse-training-with-rigl.html).
