We (here I really mean &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) have all heard of General Relativity and how it revolutionized our understanding of the world around us. Einstein&amp;rsquo;s work, although pivotal, failed in one crucial aspect: although it allowed us to describe gravity and spacetime, it did not allow us to control them. In this paper I (switching to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to avoid sounding pretentious with &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) introduce Artificial General Relativity (AGR) which, when achieved, will allow us to control gravity and spacetime.</description></item><item><title>Tips for Interviewing at Google</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/tips/interviewing/interviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/tips/interviewing/interviewing/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This post reflects my personal views and not those of my employer.

People often ask me: How do I get a job at Google?
An essential requirement is passing the interviews; unsurprisingly, this is another common question: How do I pass the Google interviews?
While there is no hard and fast rule to pass the Google interviews, I do have some tips and guidelines that have helped others in the past (including myself).</description></item><item><title>Tips for preparing your resume</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/tips/resume/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/tips/resume/resume/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This post reflects my personal views and not those of my employer.
In my previous post providing tips for interviewing at Google, I included the sentence “If you don’t know anyone at Google, you’ve already applied and haven’t heard back in a while, feel free to send me a note with your CV and I’ll see if there’s something I can do.”
I received a number of requests from people who had applied but never heard back.</description></item><item><title>ML-Jam: Performing Structured Improvisations with Pre-trained Models</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/creativity/ml-jam/ml-jam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/creativity/ml-jam/ml-jam/</guid><description>This paper, published in the International Conference on Computational Creativity, 2019, explores using pre-trained musical generative models in a collaborative setting for improvisation.

It was originally written in TensorFlow, but now all agents have been implemented in JAX.
You can read more about it in our github page and in our white paper.
Original Google AI blogpost.
We have a website where you can easily compare the performance of all the Dopamine agents, which I find really useful:
.
We also provide a set of Colaboratory notebooks that really help understand the framework:</description></item><item><title>Family - Over the Years</title><link>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/family/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2006 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://psc-g.github.io/posts/art/family/family/</guid><description>We photograph ourselves each year on our anniversary.

Read below for details!
About Music can be represented in various forms: as a series of sounds, as a score, as tabs (for guitar), as a series of chord names, as MIDI, as a NoteSequence protocol buffer, and more.
I stumbled upon the Solresol language recently, as well as upon this talk by Adam Neely, and realized that you can also represent music as colours.</description></item></channel></rss>
